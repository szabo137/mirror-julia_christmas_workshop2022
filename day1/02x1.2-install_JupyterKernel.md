# Add Julia to the Jupyter kernels

## Requirements
You need a working version of

* Julia 
* Jupyter notebook

## Install IJulia
The Julia-kernel for Jupyter is installed by using Julia itself. 
First, open the julia REPL by typing

```bash
julia
```

into your terminal.
Julia comes with a full-featured interactive command-line REPL
(read-eval-print loop) built into the julia executable.
[Click here for more info on REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/)

Then go to the pkg mode by hitting `ctrl + ]`, which turns the prompt of the REPL blue and changes its appearence to the version of Julia you use. Then type

```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> add IJulia
```
to install the package IJulia to your global Julia instance.
On a german keyboard the pkg mode can be activated by hitting `altgr + ]`
After the installation is finished, simply close the REPL by hitting `ctrl + d`.
If you now open a jupyter notebook (maybe in a virtual env), you will be able to choose julia-<version> from the available kernels.
