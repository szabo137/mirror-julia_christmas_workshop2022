# Install Julia

In order to install Julia, download the approriate binaries from the [official source](https://julialang.org/downloads/). If you have a terminal with `wget` and `tar` installed, you might try the following:

```bash
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.8/julia-1.8.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-1.8.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

It is recommented to move the julia source directory to a place, where optional user binaries are stored, e.g. 

```
mkdir opt
mv julia-1.8.3-linux-x86_64 ~/opt
```

Finally, one should add the julia executable to the PATH variable by adding

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:~/opt/julia-1.8.3/bin"
```

to your `.bashrc` or alike.

Refresh the current shell environment by sourcing the `.bashrc`

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
