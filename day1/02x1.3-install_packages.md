# Installation of the toolchain

During the workshop, but also in everyday work with Julia,
it is very convenient to have a small Julia toolchain available.
So, open your julia REPL,
go to the package manager by hitting `ctrl + ]`,
and start adding some awesome packages.

## Plots.jl
From time to time one needs to plot something. Therefore, we add julias standard plotting package:

```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> add Plots
```

This will take a while, but is comes with a lot of features!

## BenchmarkTools.jl

Benchmarking is an essential task for code development, not only in the Julia world.
However, since Julia is a jit-compiled language, benchmarking is a non-trivial task.
One needs to be aware of several language-specific things under the hood, e.g. compile-time during the first call etc.. Fortunately, Julia itself provides an excellent tool to benchmark code snippets as well as whole packages: `BenchmarkTools.jl`. As easily as other packages, we install this by typing


```julia
(@v1.8) pkg> add BenchmarkTools
```
